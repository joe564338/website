	<h2>TO TEST EMSCRIPTEN</h2>
	<p> Just click the link below for a hello world program in Transcompilation action inside emscripten</p>
	<a href="hello.html"> Test Emscripten</a>
	<h2> FOR THE OTHELLO TICTACTOE APPLICATION BELOW</h2>
	<p>Warning: For whatever reason if you are using a browser like Internet Explorer or Google Chrome
	You can only see the output in the javascript console.  Not sure why this is but Mozilla works fine
	and so does the Windows 10 Edge browser.  Haven't tested others.  In order to input a line YOU MUST
	type in your input, click ok and then click cancel in order for it to read.  And there is a minor 
	bug where sometimes the window will disapear and the script will go nuts.  Sorry I'm somewhat new to
	transcompilation and emscripten so I don't know exactly what to do to make it like it is when running
	it natively in C++.<br>
	First you got to choose the game by typing in 1 or 2.  Remember click OK then Cancel for it to go 
	through properly.  Then to type in a move, Type move (c, r)  where c is the collumn (x) and r is the row
	(y).<br>
	You can undo moves with undo n, with n being the number of moves you wish to undo. <br>
	And if you are playing othello and have no available moves type: move pass.<br>
	Also PLease click ok and cancel and don't use enter as that usually leads to the pop up window 
	disappearing forever until you reload the page.<br></p>

	<h2> FOR THE C HEAP APPLICATION BELOW</h2>
	<p> The Heap application below has the same browser issue as the othello application above. The screen wont
	show anything until the app completes if you are not using firefox or edge.  Basically its just 5 different 
	test cases for testing My custom C heap I had to make for a class.  Its not perfect but its pretty neat to 
	understand how malloc and free works in C.  So just type in a number 1 through 5 and submit that with an ok
	then cancel to see the tester in action.  Shows memory locations of variables on the custom C heap.</p>

	<h2> FOR THE STANDARD DEVIATION WITH CUSTOM C HEAP APPLICATION BELOW</h2>
	<p> The Standard Deviation application below calculates standard deviation while using my custom c heap.
	For whatever reason the first text prompt doesn't come up before the input window in mozilla even though 
	it does in the code if ran natively in C.  So at the first input type the number of numbers you want to use
	for the calculation.  Then click ok and cancel once again.  After that if you are running in mozilla you 
	should be asked to type a number. This is where you would put your first number for calculation.  After 
	typing the number click ok and cancel.  The window and prompt will come up again however many times you
	entered at the very beginning. So repeat as necessary.  After finishing all your inputs the app will finish
	with the result on the bottom and throughout the application locations of memory used will also be outputted.</p>
